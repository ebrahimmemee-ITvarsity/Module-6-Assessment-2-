                <p>The BMW M4 is a version of the BMW 4 Series automobile developed by BMW's motorsport division, 
                    BMW M, that has been built since 2014. 
                    As part of the renumbering that splits the coup√© and convertible variants of the 3 Series into the 4 Series, 
                    the M4 replaced those variants of the BMW M3. Upgrades over the standard BMW 4 Series include an upgraded engine, 
                    suspension, exhaust system, brakes and weight reduction measures including increased use of carbon fibre, 
                    such as on the roof of the car.</p>
